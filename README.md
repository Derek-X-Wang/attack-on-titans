## Why

> I failed my google interview couple months ago. It's my fault. I didn't do my homework and was way too nervous. However, it still made feel bad. So, I was thinking, "why not make it become easier for everyone?" This is my little 'revenge'. Hope it will be useful for you also.

## Help Wanted!!!
- The script. It has been quite long since my interview. I don't really remember what exactly my interviewer said... Not only google but also other big tech firms.
- Developers who has done phone screen with Apple, Amazon, FB and etc. Let's make their interviews easier, together.
